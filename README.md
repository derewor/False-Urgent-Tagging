# False-Urgent-Tagging
The project analyses the frequency of false urgent tagging of company managers.

## Specific Objectives
1. To determine the proportion of urgent messages that managers are involved in.
2. To determine the proportion of true urgent messages in wchih the managers involved in.
3. To chracterize test structure of false urgent messages.

## Structure
Analyzed data:\ This folder in the repository contains the analyzed datasets used for visualization.

src:\ This folder contains the jupyter notbook with an active code.

Result:\ This folder contains the overall report of the analysis.

## Tools

Pandas, Numpy, SQL, Jupyter Notebook, Spreadsheet

## Results

I analysed 59k+ Slack messages to understand why managers are constantly pulled into "urgent" issues. The findings reveal a communication crisis:

üìä **The Escalation Problem:**

- 16% of threads escalated to management
- Only 3.5% of manager tags were actually urgent
- 71.8% of "urgent" requests took >24 hours to resolve

**The False Urgency Pattern:** Non-urgent messages had telltale signs: ‚ö†Ô∏è 15-22% more exclamation marks (!) and question marks (?)

**The Hidden Cost:** When 96.5% of manager escalations aren't truly urgent, we create:

- Leadership bandwidth waste
- Delayed response to real emergencies
- Escalation fatigue across teams
